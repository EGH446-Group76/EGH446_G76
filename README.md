# Getting Started
This project was developed using MATLAB R2025a & Simulink (academic use). The required toolboxes are listed in `sim_env/GettingStarted.mlx`.

# Opening the Model
To open the correct Simulink Model, run the `startupGround.m` script from the `sim_env/` directory. The actual Simulink Model file can be found at `sim_env/toolboxes/ground_robot/sl_groundvehicleDynamics.slx`.
